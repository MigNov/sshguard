#!/bin/bash

# Argument list:
#
# First argument is action, it has to be one of the following:
#    init - initialize firewall connection and check for privileges
#    finish - finalize firewall connection
#    block - block address, accepts also SSHG_ADDRKING (e.g. 4) as argument 2 and SSHG_ADDR (IP address) as argument 3
#    release - the same like above, except used for unblocking the addresses
#    flush - flush all the addresses (remove them from blocking)
#
ACTION="$1"
SSHG_ADDRKIND="$2"
SSHG_ADDR="$3"
